Usage of /opt/bin/kube-controller-manager:

# kubernetes-vagrant-coreos-cluster

  --service-account-private-key-file="":  Filename containing a PEM-encoded private RSA key used to sign service account tokens.

  --cloud-provider="":                    The provider for cloud services.  Empty string for no provider.

  --master="":                            The address of the Kubernetes API server (overrides any value in kubeconfig)

  --pod-eviction-timeout=5m0s:            The grace peroid for deleting pods on failed nodes.

  --logtostderr=true:                     log to standard error instead of files



# log

  --alsologtostderr=false:                log to standard error as well as files

  --log-backtrace-at=:0:                  when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace

  --log-dir=:                             If non-empty, write log files in this directory

  --log-flush-frequency=5s:               Maximum number of seconds between log flushes

  --stderrthreshold=2:                    logs at or above this threshold go to stderr

  --v=0:                                  log level for V logs

  --vmodule=:                             comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging



# node

  --node-monitor-grace-period=40s:        Amount of time which we allow running Node to be unresponsive before marking it unhealty.
                                          Must be N times more than kubelet's nodeStatusUpdateFrequency, where N means number of
                                          retries allowed for kubelet to post node status.

  --node-monitor-period=5s:               The period for syncing NodeStatus in NodeController.

  --node-startup-grace-period=1m0s:       Amount of time which we allow starting Node to be unresponsive before marking it unhealty.

  --node-sync-period=10s:                 The period for syncing nodes from cloudprovider. Longer periods will result in
                                          fewer calls to cloud provider, but may delay addition of new nodes to cluster.



# security

  --root-ca-file="":                      If set, this root certificate authority will be included in service account's token secret.
                                          This must be a valid PEM-encoded CA bundle.



# address / port

  --address=127.0.0.1:                    The IP address to serve on (set to 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces)

  --allocate-node-cidrs=false:            Should CIDRs for Pods be allocated and set on the cloud provider.

  --cluster-cidr=<nil>:                   CIDR Range for Pods in cluster.

  --httptest.serve=:                      if non-empty, httptest.NewServer serves on this address and blocks

  --port=10252:                           The port that the controller-manager's http service runs on




# performance

  --concurrent-endpoint-syncs=5:          The number of endpoint syncing operations that will be done concurrently.
                                          Larger number = faster endpoint updating, but more CPU (and network) load

  --concurrent-rc-syncs=5:                The number of replication controllers that are allowed to sync concurrently.
                                          Larger number = more reponsive replica management, but more CPU (and network) load

  --deleting-pods-burst=10:               Number of nodes on which pods are bursty deleted in case of node failure.
                                          For more details look into RateLimiter.

  --deleting-pods-qps=0.1:                Number of nodes per second on which pods are deleted in case of node failure.

  --namespace-sync-period=5m0s:           The period for syncing namespace life-cycle updates

  --pvclaimbinder-sync-period=10s:        The period for syncing persistent volumes and persistent volume claims

  --register-retry-count=10:              The number of retries for initial node registration.
                                          Retry interval equals node-sync-period.

  --resource-quota-sync-period=10s:       The period for syncing quota usage status in the system




# others

  --cloud-config="":                      The path to the cloud provider configuration file.  Empty string
                                          for no configuration file.

  --cluster-name="kubernetes":            The instance prefix for the cluster

  --kubeconfig="":                        Path to kubeconfig file with authorization and master location information.

  --profiling=true:                       Enable profiling via web interface host:port/debug/pprof/

  --version=false:                        Print version information and quit
